This repository is for scientific and educational purposes. It shows my work on recreating mathematical algorithms and models from academic papers 


1. Bayes Algorithm 

Inspired by academic paper found https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/courses/281A-fall04/lectures/lec-9-30.pdf

2. Clustering 

K-means


Using multivariate gaussian model 

Standard EM algorithm (Expectation and Minimisation).

Loop: Algorithm is iterated n times 

Calculating each step:

Goal:
